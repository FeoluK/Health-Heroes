Design Scheme:
Use a black and gray color scheme with a purple accent for highlights. Keep the layout minimalistic, accessible, and consistent with iOS design standards. Base text color should be white or light gray for readability. Incorporate subtle purple highlights (buttons, links, or headings) to emphasize interactive elements.

SwiftUI UI Design Rules:

Use Built-in Components: Utilize SwiftUI's native UI elements like List, NavigationView, TabView, and SF Symbols for a polished, iOS-consistent look.
Master Layout Tools: Employ VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, and Padding for responsive designs; use LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid for grids; GeometryReader for dynamic layouts.
Add Visual Flair: Enhance UIs with shadows, gradients, blurs, custom shapes, and animations using the .animation() modifier for smooth transitions.
Design for Interaction: Incorporate gestures (swipes, long presses), haptic feedback, clear navigation, and responsive elements to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
